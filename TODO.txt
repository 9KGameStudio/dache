-Switch WCF serialization to protobuf if it makes sense (if it is faster?)
-Consider Streamed WCF?
-Offer both IIS hosting and classic Service hosting
-Better way to do static Container classes?
-clear tag from memory when removing all tagged items from host
-"Key Chain" where I could add an object at key Test1, then Key Chain Test2 to Test1 so that it would return the same object and when Test1 is removed, so is Test2.
    -All related keys should be on the same server and the client should somehow deterministically know this... therein lies the tricky part
